  <em>Welcome to my site!</em>
  <br><br>
  Ever since I could remember, I've seen the world differently than all my friends and family around me. I spoke in song. I smelled of paint. I dreamed in color. I loved in poetry. When everyone else was out riding their bikes, I was reading books under the trees. Lost in thought and reveries.
  <br><br>
  I'm proud of the weirdness. And I love that about myself. I take that 'out-of-the-box-ness' and turn it into whatever I need it to be. Code. Digital art. A song. A poem.
  <br><br>
   My hobies include turning crazy ideas into programs, unconventional whims into JavaScript, and coffee into code. I have experience in JavaScript, CSS, Photoshop, art, design, Git, GitHub, and every day I'm expanding the database.
  <br><br>
  I love to merge my passions of art and technology to make something the world has never seen before.
  <br><br>
  I've always got an idea or two up my sleeve. Contact me if you want to talk about it!
